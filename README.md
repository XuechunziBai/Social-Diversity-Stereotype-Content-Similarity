You will find raw survey contents for Study 2. 

Study 1 and Study 3 are archival data, please refer to the original studies for raw materials.


#### In Data folder: 
There are data_raw, data_main, and data_SI.

You can skip raw and SI data, jump into the main data file to replicate the analysis in the main text.

For those who are interested, please see raw data and SI data in the remaining two files.

Each file is an xlsx, therefore contains multiple spreadsheets.

 
#### In Code folder: 
You will find programming codes, correspond to each data file.

Again, you can replicate the main analysis by applying the code file 'data_main'.

For those who are interested, please see the other two coding repo.

Suggest open in Notepad or other equivalent to read.


#### In FigureA, international scm, and us scm folder: 
You will find figures in higher resolution.

Figure_main_ms contains figures you see in the manuscript, both colored and grayed.

Figure_si contains figures in the supplmentary materials.

Interactive plots contain world map and united states map, with diversity and stereotype dispersion annotated, geographically.

Click your mouse and you will see the numbers on the map.

DataVis (py. and xlsx.) are for those who want to replicate drawing the figures themselves.


#### In Revise folder:
